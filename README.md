# admin-dashboard
An admin dashboard example which is used to practice CSS Grid and Flexbox

Did mine slightly different then the example I wanted to make it so you can dynamically add projects without messing with the announcements and trending section. I accomoblished this by making an overall flex box with the main content section and the have the projects be a grid while the annuncements and trending section act as a second sidebar
